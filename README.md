# project-personal-portfolio
Simple personal portfolio.
This project is a soultion for one of the topic on TheOdinProject course "Project: personal Portfolio in Advance HTML and CSS section". To make a portfolio I used HTMl, CSS and JavaScript only. I also used fontawesome as a source of icons. Everything lokks like dark theme, my favourite.
